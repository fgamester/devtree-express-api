# Social Media Dev Tree

Hello there👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼  
I was curious about learning Express, so i decided to develop this project that allow you to create an account on it and unify all your social media.

Important: This is Only the Backend side.

Used Technologies:
-TypeScript  
-Express  
-Mongoose  
-MongoDB  

## You want to try it?

### Try the deployed project on Vercel
*In progress...*

### Get the repository to your local workspace

First of all you need to clone the repository :
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fgamester/devtree-express-front
```
Then run the packages installation command:
```bash
$ npm run install
```
And finally run the server locally with the following command:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
The project will be running at the 4000 port, so you will have to type [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) on your web browser or go there by clicking the marked link.
